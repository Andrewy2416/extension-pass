## User Story
We wanted to create a website that would easily allow users to share their travel destinations for others members. <br>
This website will create a community for like minded people to share their ideas, ratings and suggestions for popular and hard-to-find spots across the globe. <br>
We took inspiration from popular social media websites that allow users to freely communicate with each other. <br>
Even now during times of COVID 19, people are still traveling. Sharing tips and suggestions to fellow travelers will help knit the community back together.

## Future Plans
○ Sharing and Hosting User uploaded pictures and videos <br>
○ Travel suggestions based on user tagged cities; if the user visited and have high ratings for at least 3 similar cities, our database would recommend a 4th city with similar traits the user might enjoy
