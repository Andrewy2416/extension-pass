## User Story
AS a traveller:
I want to document my experiences to cities I’ve visited
SO THAT others know what to expect when visiting certain destinations.
GIVEN a user creates an account:

WHEN I create/login into an account,
THEN I am presented with the main page with options to document cities I’ve visited, places I want to go, and read user-generated reviews that other users have created for certain cities.

WHEN I click dashboard,
THEN I am shown a list of my previous posts.

WHEN I want to create a new post,
THEN I am prompted to enter the location I visited, and enter a text describing my travels to said city.

WHEN I want to comment on a post,
THEN I click on comments and it will allow us to comment on a post, and the number of comments on a post will reflect in the main page.

## Motivation for the team
We felt that travelling was something that was going to be on everyone’s New Year’s resolution, if not next year, then the year after.
We thought that this would be a good balance in demonstrating our knowledge in the subject matter, while simple enough to be able to complete in a timely fashion, as we didn’t want to run into production hiccups like we did in our last project. 


## Elevator Pitch
Extension Pass is a comparative travel blog where we take user input on places they’ve been to, any notes they took on their destinations, and list any other locations they would like to visit in the near future. 
Here, users will be able to not only share their travel stories, but also see the experiences of others as worldwide travel plans are being made. This way, users will be better informed on what destinations are unique, and which destinations can be passed on.

## Future Plans!

○ Something we want to do is to allow users to upload any photos/videos they took at these locations to their individual posts like you see on Reddit, Instagram, or Facebook <br>
○ Algorithm that makes suggestions on new destinations to visit based on your previous post locations and/or your search history. <br>
○ Search functionality for specific cities you want to look up.
